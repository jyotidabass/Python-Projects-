It’s like being a detective who uses clues (data) to solve mysteries (business problems or questions).  ✍️The Data Science Process Imagine you’re trying to solve a puzzle. You need to follow a series of steps to find the solution. Data science follows a similar process:  Problem Definition: Identify a problem or question you want to answer. This is the puzzle you want to solve. Data Collection: Gather data related to the problem. This is like collecting clues for your puzzle. Data Cleaning: Make sure the data is accurate and in a usable format. This is like sorting and filtering your clues to make them useful. Data Analysis: Use various techniques (like statistics, machine learning, and visualization) to examine the data and find patterns. This is like using your clues to start solving the puzzle. Insight Generation: Draw conclusions from your analysis and identify potential solutions to the problem. This is like finding the missing piece that completes the puzzle. Communication: Share your findings with others, using visualization and storytelling techniques to make the insights easy to understand. This is like explaining the solution to the puzzle to others.\n",
